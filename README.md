# CheckoutSimulation
A queue-based checkout line simulation to compare the performance of three different algorithms for selecting a queue.

To run different CheckoutSimulations, run in the terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/JunnanShimizu/GameOfLife.git
```
```
cd CheckoutSimulation
```

Depending on which simulation you'd like to run, compile and run:

```
javac Pick2CustomerSimulation.java
java Pick2CustomerSimulation.java
```
```
javac PickyCustomerSimulation.java
java PickyCustomerSimulation.java
```
```
javac RandomCustomerSimulation.java
java RandomCustomerSimulation.java
```
